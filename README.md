# WAGMI Challenge 001 ‚Äì WAGMI 9000

This repository contains my solution to the **WAGMI Challenge 001**, focused on building a simple and efficient **HTTP load tester** using Rust.

## Overview

The goal of the challenge was to create a tool that simulates HTTP GET requests to a target URL and measures basic performance metrics such as:

- Request throughput
- Response latency
- Success/failure counts

My solution is built with Rust with an emphasis on concurrency and speed.

## File Structure

- `main.rs` ‚Äì CLI entrypoint that handles argument parsing and launches the load test.
- `load_test.rs` ‚Äì Script for stress testing main.rs with concurrent requests.

## Features

- Asynchronous requests with `tokio` and `reqwest`
- Configurable number of concurrent requests
- Total requests & concurrency levels via CLI args
- Aggregated stats: average latency, success/failure counts
- Graceful handling of errors and timeouts

## Dependencies

This project uses the following crates:

- [`actix-web`](https://docs.rs/actix-web) ‚Äì Web framework for building fast and secure web services.
- [`sonic-rs`](https://docs.rs/sonic-rs) ‚Äì Ultra-fast JSON parser for Rust (based on [simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson)).
- [`chrono`](https://docs.rs/chrono) ‚Äì Date and time handling.
- [`tokio`](https://docs.rs/tokio) ‚Äì Asynchronous runtime with support for multi-threaded execution and timing utilities.
- [`serde`](https://docs.rs/serde) and [`serde_json`](https://docs.rs/serde_json) ‚Äì Serialization and deserialization of data structures and JSON.
- [`once_cell`](https://docs.rs/once_cell) ‚Äì Efficient global single-assignment values.
- [`futures`](https://docs.rs/futures) ‚Äì Abstractions for asynchronous programming.
- [`reqwest`](https://docs.rs/reqwest) ‚Äì HTTP client with JSON support for making network requests.

## Learnings

* Leveraged async/await and Rust's type system to safely manage high concurrency.
* Practiced error handling and graceful exits for robust CLI tools.
* Learned efficient data aggregation under concurrent workloads.
